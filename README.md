Based on David Garcia's (https://github.com/david-gpu/srez) with some help from mikesj's code (though it uses Theano).
I added features to the code which allows it to be used for images not from the celebrity dataset. 

Todo:
Enable a pure black-and-white mode to save training time
Automatically detect objects in a large image and crop out the background
